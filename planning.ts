// mock data and I want to store in localStorage only and what the data like it should be stored in localStorage
// - users {userId (make sure it's unique) it should be in format like user-number(make sure this number / id unique) something like that, name, email, password}[]

// 5. when add column, columnId and columnName should be added in columns table
